Main unit:
* 3.2″ Touchscreen LCD for system status and interaction.
* DS18B20 temperature sensor.
* DHT11 humidity sensor.
* Photoresistor for light level.
* Real Time Clock with backup battery.
* Relay for an AC waterpump.
* RGB LED and buzzer for status.
* 3x RJ45 I/O ports.

Reservoir sensing module:
* Atlas Scientific pH sensor circuit
* Atlas Scientific EC sensor circuit
* HC-SR04 sonar sensor for measuring nutrient tank level.
